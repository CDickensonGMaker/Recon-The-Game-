# RECONgame Performance Ledger

The single honest record of measured frame rates. Every number here names the render scale it
was measured at (the standing sin — bead `365s` — was quoting scaled numbers as if native).

## Measurement contract
- **Always record `rendering/scaling_3d/scale`.** `0.77` = 59.3% of native pixels; a number at 0.77 is
  NOT a native number.
- **Always record the renderer** (`rendering/rendering_method`). Still **unset** in `project.godot`, so
  the engine defaults to **Forward+** on desktop. Choosing a renderer is a real architecture decision —
  left for the Summoner / a War Room, not set silently.
- Harness: `tests/perf_probe.tscn` (windowed, NOT headless) loads `game_world.tscn` at a fixed seed,
  skips a 5s warm-up, then samples `Engine.get_frames_per_second()` to 45s. Run via Godot MCP
  `run_project` with that scene.

### 2026-07-16 — first HONEST native profile (Track A1 / bead 365s)
- **Native FPS ≈ 27** (steady 24–29 range), main-game jungle.
- Config: `scaling_3d/scale = 1.0` (temporarily set for the measurement, then **restored to 0.77** —
  native was measured, not shipped), renderer **Forward+** (default, unset), seed 2077.
- Hardware: **Intel UHD Graphics**, Vulkan 1.3, Godot 4.7.stable.
- Scene load: 25 terrain chunks (5×5, 1280m map), ~13,000+ tree + rice billboards map-wide, 46 water
  bodies, GameplayGrid 256×256. Consistent with the bead's ~350k alpha-tested overdraw estimate.
- **Surprise vs the bead's prediction:** `365s` predicted native would be **12–16 FPS**. It is **~27** —
  roughly **2× better** than the pessimistic estimate. Still below the 30 FPS gate, but not the disaster
  the void numbers implied. The FPS=1 sample in the log is a one-frame screenshot-capture stall
  (measurement artifact), not a real dip.
- For reference: the old "40–41 on 4.7" figure was at 0.77 (59% pixels); a like-for-like 0.77 re-measure
  was not run this pass.

## Still owed (does NOT close 365s)
1. **Per-system attribution** — the probe gives a whole-frame number; it does not yet split billboards
   vs terrain vs water vs characters into a per-ms budget. That attribution is the next step before any
   optimization bet.
2. **Set a gating FPS number** — the decree in `365s` step 4. Deferred to the Summoner: native-27 is the
   honest floor to gate against.
3. **`rendering_method` decision** — pick and commit a renderer (Forward+ vs Mobile vs Compatibility on
   an Intel UHD target) deliberately, not by default.

# RECONgame Performance Ledger

The single honest record of measured frame rates. Every number here names the render scale it
was measured at (the standing sin — bead `365s` — was quoting scaled numbers as if native).

## Measurement contract
- **Always record `rendering/scaling_3d/scale`.** `0.77` = 59.3% of native pixels; a number at 0.77 is
  NOT a native number.
- **Always record the renderer** (`rendering/rendering_method`). Still **unset** in `project.godot`, so
  the engine defaults to **Forward+** on desktop. Choosing a renderer is a real architecture decision —
  left for the Summoner / a War Room, not set silently.
- Harness: `tests/perf_probe.tscn` (windowed, NOT headless) loads `game_world.tscn` at a fixed seed,
  skips a 5s warm-up, then samples `Engine.get_frames_per_second()` to 45s. Run via Godot MCP
  `run_project` with that scene.

## Entries

### 2026-07-16 — first HONEST native profile (Track A1 / bead 365s)
- **Native FPS ≈ 27** (steady 24–29 range), main-game jungle.
- Config: `scaling_3d/scale = 1.0` (temporarily set for the measurement, then **restored to 0.77** —
  native was measured, not shipped), renderer **Forward+** (default, unset), seed 2077.
- Hardware: **Intel UHD Graphics**, Vulkan 1.3, Godot 4.7.stable.
- Scene load: 25 terrain chunks (5×5, 1280m map), ~13,000+ tree + rice billboards map-wide, 46 water
  bodies, GameplayGrid 256×256. Consistent with the bead's ~350k alpha-tested overdraw estimate.
- **Surprise vs the bead's prediction:** `365s` predicted native would be **12–16 FPS**. It is **~27** —
  roughly **2× better** than the pessimistic estimate. Still below the 30 FPS gate, but not the disaster
  the void numbers implied. The FPS=1 sample in the log is a one-frame screenshot-capture stall
  (measurement artifact), not a real dip.
- For reference: the old "40–41 on 4.7" figure was at 0.77 (59% pixels); a like-for-like 0.77 re-measure
  was not run this pass.

### 2026-07-16 — Phase 0 per-system attribution (bead t5mo)
Harness: `perf_probe.gd` extended to sample `RenderingServer.get_rendering_info` and to cycle each
foliage system off one window at a time (`perf_probe_cycle.tscn`). Stationary camera at the AO-center
spawn, seed 2077, **scale 1.0**, renderer Forward+ (default). Numbers are per-frame averages over each
~4.5s window.

| phase | fps avg | prims | draw calls | objects |
|-------|--------:|------:|-----------:|--------:|
| baseline (all on) | 24.4* | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |
| billboards OFF | **32.5** | 181,666 | 56 | 143 |
| jungle patches OFF | 29.8 | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |
| grass OFF | 29.6 | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |

\* baseline avg is dragged down by the one-frame screenshot-capture stall (fps_min 7.0). The
patches-OFF / grass-OFF windows render byte-identical frames to baseline and read ~29.6 — that is the
true stationary native baseline (consistent with the earlier 24–29 range).

**The finding — billboards are the whole story, and it is measured now, not estimated:**
- Disabling **`BillboardVegetation`** removes **120,220 primitives (40% of the frame)**, **108 of the
  164 draw calls (66%)**, 108 objects, and gains **+8.2 FPS → 32.5, which clears the 30 gate on its own.**
- Disabling **jungle patches** and **grass** changes primitives / draw calls / objects by **ZERO** at
  this pose. Their toggles fire; they simply have nothing in range to hide (patches render <128m, grass
  <60m, and the AO-center spawn sits on open ground). Their apparent "+5 FPS" is the *absence* of the
  screenshot stall, not a real saving — the identical prim/call/object counts prove it.
- **Correction to the plan / bead:** the plan ranked patches the #2 GPU driver. At the measured spawn
  pose they are not a driver at all; **billboards are ~the entire controllable foliage cost.** Patch
  cost would rise if the camera stood inside a dense patch field, but billboards are the always-on
  80–600m far-field fill and the unambiguous primary target. Phase 1 targets billboards only; patches
  are left untouched (also protects Pillar 2 atmosphere + LOS).
- Total-frame context: ~302k prims with terrain (25 chunks × ~8k tris ≈ 180k) as the other big block —
  terrain is not a cut target. The old "~350k overdraw" estimate was in the right order of magnitude but
  wrongly attributed; the real attributable-and-cuttable block is the 120k billboard prims.

### 2026-07-16 — Phase 1/2/3 (bead t5mo). Measurement note: vsync + the real bottleneck
**Vsync was quantising every prior number.** `project.godot` has no vsync key (defaults ON) + fullscreen;
on a 60Hz panel that pins the GPU to 30/60 half-steps, so 24–29 "native" was partly a vsync artifact.
`perf_probe.gd` now forces `VSYNC_DISABLED` + `max_fps=0` for a true-throughput read. All numbers below
are vsync-off, scale=1.0, seed 2077, stationary AO-center spawn (open hillside — see caveat).

**The bottleneck is fill/pipeline, NOT geometry (measured, decisive):**
| change | prims | draw calls | fps (Forward+) |
|--------|------:|-----------:|---------------:|
| Forward+ baseline | 301,886 | 164 | ~29.2 |
| billboards single-sided (CULL_BACK) | 301,886* | 164 | ~29.2 |
| + billboard range 600→350m | 202,386 | 87 | ~28.9 |

\* `TOTAL_PRIMITIVES_IN_FRAME` counts submitted tris — back-face culling saves fill, not primitive count.
Cutting **99,500 prims (33%) and 77 draw calls moved FPS by ~0.** Geometry/draw-call count is not the
jungle's limiter at this pose; full-screen terrain/water fragment shading + the render pipeline is.

**Phase 1 kept (both free / near-free, no measured FPS cost but reduce worst-case fill):**
- Billboards **single-sided** (`CULL_DISABLED`→`CULL_BACK`; the mesh authors both faces so both sides
  still draw — half the fill, identical silhouette).
- Billboard **range 600→350m** (fog at 0.004 already hides >75% of a 350m card; zero visible cutoff).
- **Reverted** the density pull (candidates 3000, unchanged) — it cost Pillar-2 atmosphere for zero
  measured FPS. Alpha-hash (Change 2) **skipped** — its early-Z benefit is nil when the frame isn't
  geometry-bound, and it adds shimmer for no gain.

**Phase 2 — FPS ladder wired (discharges the world_config MISSING-FEATURE fossil, 97→95):**
`VEGETATION_DENSITY_MULT` now scales billboard+grass+tree candidate counts; `BILLBOARD_DISTANCE_MULT`
scales billboard draw range. Manual quality dial (edit const + reboot). NOTE: because geometry isn't the
limiter, this dial buys little FPS — it's a fossil-discharge + memory/CPU-gen lever, not the FPS fix.

**Phase 3 — RENDERER A/B (the real win):**
| renderer | fps (native, scale 1.0) | clears 30 gate? |
|----------|------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Forward+ (default) | ~29.2 | NO |
| **Mobile (Forward Mobile)** | **40.9** | **YES (+40%, at native)** |
Nothing Forward+-only is used (no SDFGI/SSIL/SSAO/glow/volumetrics/SSR; shadows+MSAA already off). Mobile
clears the gate at NATIVE resolution — the shipped 0.77 FSR upscale becomes unnecessary (FSR1 is
Forward+-only anyway). Visual A/B: clean, on-aesthetic, arguably sharper. **Recommendation pending a
right-sized War Room + Summoner sign-off (renderer is a 365s architecture call).**

## Still owed (does NOT close 365s)
1. **Per-system attribution** — the probe gives a whole-frame number; it does not yet split billboards
   vs terrain vs water vs characters into a per-ms budget. That attribution is the next step before any
   optimization bet.
2. **Set a gating FPS number** — the decree in `365s` step 4. Deferred to the Summoner: native-27 is the
   honest floor to gate against.
3. **`rendering_method` decision** — pick and commit a renderer (Forward+ vs Mobile vs Compatibility on
   an Intel UHD target) deliberately, not by default.

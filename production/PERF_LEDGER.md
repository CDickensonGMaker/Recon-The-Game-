# RECONgame Performance Ledger

The single honest record of measured frame rates. Every number here names the render scale it
was measured at (the standing sin — bead `365s` — was quoting scaled numbers as if native).

## Measurement contract
- **Always record `rendering/scaling_3d/scale`.** `0.77` = 59.3% of native pixels; a number at 0.77 is
  NOT a native number.
- **Always record the renderer** (`rendering/rendering_method`). Still **unset** in `project.godot`, so
  the engine defaults to **Forward+** on desktop. Choosing a renderer is a real architecture decision —
  left for the Summoner / a War Room, not set silently.
- Harness: `tests/perf_probe.tscn` (windowed, NOT headless) loads `game_world.tscn` at a fixed seed,
  skips a 5s warm-up, then samples `Engine.get_frames_per_second()` to 45s. Run via Godot MCP
  `run_project` with that scene.

## Entries

### 2026-07-16 — first HONEST native profile (Track A1 / bead 365s)
- **Native FPS ≈ 27** (steady 24–29 range), main-game jungle.
- Config: `scaling_3d/scale = 1.0` (temporarily set for the measurement, then **restored to 0.77** —
  native was measured, not shipped), renderer **Forward+** (default, unset), seed 2077.
- Hardware: **Intel UHD Graphics**, Vulkan 1.3, Godot 4.7.stable.
- Scene load: 25 terrain chunks (5×5, 1280m map), ~13,000+ tree + rice billboards map-wide, 46 water
  bodies, GameplayGrid 256×256. Consistent with the bead's ~350k alpha-tested overdraw estimate.
- **Surprise vs the bead's prediction:** `365s` predicted native would be **12–16 FPS**. It is **~27** —
  roughly **2× better** than the pessimistic estimate. Still below the 30 FPS gate, but not the disaster
  the void numbers implied. The FPS=1 sample in the log is a one-frame screenshot-capture stall
  (measurement artifact), not a real dip.
- For reference: the old "40–41 on 4.7" figure was at 0.77 (59% pixels); a like-for-like 0.77 re-measure
  was not run this pass.

### 2026-07-16 — Phase 0 per-system attribution (bead t5mo)
Harness: `perf_probe.gd` extended to sample `RenderingServer.get_rendering_info` and to cycle each
foliage system off one window at a time (`perf_probe_cycle.tscn`). Stationary camera at the AO-center
spawn, seed 2077, **scale 1.0**, renderer Forward+ (default). Numbers are per-frame averages over each
~4.5s window.

| phase | fps avg | prims | draw calls | objects |
|-------|--------:|------:|-----------:|--------:|
| baseline (all on) | 24.4* | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |
| billboards OFF | **32.5** | 181,666 | 56 | 143 |
| jungle patches OFF | 29.8 | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |
| grass OFF | 29.6 | 301,886 | 164 | 251 |

\* baseline avg is dragged down by the one-frame screenshot-capture stall (fps_min 7.0). The
patches-OFF / grass-OFF windows render byte-identical frames to baseline and read ~29.6 — that is the
true stationary native baseline (consistent with the earlier 24–29 range).

**The finding — billboards are the whole story, and it is measured now, not estimated:**
- Disabling **`BillboardVegetation`** removes **120,220 primitives (40% of the frame)**, **108 of the
  164 draw calls (66%)**, 108 objects, and gains **+8.2 FPS → 32.5, which clears the 30 gate on its own.**
- Disabling **jungle patches** and **grass** changes primitives / draw calls / objects by **ZERO** at
  this pose. Their toggles fire; they simply have nothing in range to hide (patches render <128m, grass
  <60m, and the AO-center spawn sits on open ground). Their apparent "+5 FPS" is the *absence* of the
  screenshot stall, not a real saving — the identical prim/call/object counts prove it.
- **Correction to the plan / bead:** the plan ranked patches the #2 GPU driver. At the measured spawn
  pose they are not a driver at all; **billboards are ~the entire controllable foliage cost.** Patch
  cost would rise if the camera stood inside a dense patch field, but billboards are the always-on
  80–600m far-field fill and the unambiguous primary target. Phase 1 targets billboards only; patches
  are left untouched (also protects Pillar 2 atmosphere + LOS).
- Total-frame context: ~302k prims with terrain (25 chunks × ~8k tris ≈ 180k) as the other big block —
  terrain is not a cut target. The old "~350k overdraw" estimate was in the right order of magnitude but
  wrongly attributed; the real attributable-and-cuttable block is the 120k billboard prims.

### 2026-07-16 — Phase 1/2/3 (bead t5mo). Measurement note: vsync + the real bottleneck
**Vsync was quantising every prior number.** `project.godot` has no vsync key (defaults ON) + fullscreen;
on a 60Hz panel that pins the GPU to 30/60 half-steps, so 24–29 "native" was partly a vsync artifact.
`perf_probe.gd` now forces `VSYNC_DISABLED` + `max_fps=0` for a true-throughput read. All numbers below
are vsync-off, scale=1.0, seed 2077, stationary AO-center spawn (open hillside — see caveat).

**The bottleneck is fill/pipeline, NOT geometry (measured, decisive):**
| change | prims | draw calls | fps (Forward+) |
|--------|------:|-----------:|---------------:|
| Forward+ baseline | 301,886 | 164 | ~29.2 |
| billboards single-sided (CULL_BACK) | 301,886* | 164 | ~29.2 |
| + billboard range 600→350m | 202,386 | 87 | ~28.9 |

\* `TOTAL_PRIMITIVES_IN_FRAME` counts submitted tris — back-face culling saves fill, not primitive count.
Cutting **99,500 prims (33%) and 77 draw calls moved FPS by ~0.** Geometry/draw-call count is not the
jungle's limiter at this pose; full-screen terrain/water fragment shading + the render pipeline is.

**Phase 1 kept (both free / near-free, no measured FPS cost but reduce worst-case fill):**
- Billboards **single-sided** (`CULL_DISABLED`→`CULL_BACK`; the mesh authors both faces so both sides
  still draw — half the fill, identical silhouette).
- Billboard **range 600→350m** (fog at 0.004 already hides >75% of a 350m card; zero visible cutoff).
- **Reverted** the density pull (candidates 3000, unchanged) — it cost Pillar-2 atmosphere for zero
  measured FPS. Alpha-hash (Change 2) **skipped** — its early-Z benefit is nil when the frame isn't
  geometry-bound, and it adds shimmer for no gain.

**Phase 2 — FPS ladder wired (discharges the world_config MISSING-FEATURE fossil, 97→95):**
`VEGETATION_DENSITY_MULT` now scales billboard+grass+tree candidate counts; `BILLBOARD_DISTANCE_MULT`
scales billboard draw range. Manual quality dial (edit const + reboot). NOTE: because geometry isn't the
limiter, this dial buys little FPS — it's a fossil-discharge + memory/CPU-gen lever, not the FPS fix.

**Phase 3 — RENDERER A/B (the real win):**
| renderer | fps (native, scale 1.0) | clears 30 gate? |
|----------|------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Forward+ (default) | ~29.2 | NO |
| **Mobile (Forward Mobile)** | **40.9** | **YES (+40%, at native)** |
Nothing Forward+-only is used (no SDFGI/SSIL/SSAO/glow/volumetrics/SSR; shadows+MSAA already off). Mobile
clears the gate at NATIVE resolution — the shipped 0.77 FSR upscale becomes unnecessary (FSR1 is
Forward+-only anyway). Visual A/B: clean, on-aesthetic, arguably sharper. **Recommendation pending a
right-sized War Room + Summoner sign-off (renderer is a 365s architecture call).**

## Still owed (does NOT close 365s)
1. **Per-system attribution** — the probe gives a whole-frame number; it does not yet split billboards
   vs terrain vs water vs characters into a per-ms budget. That attribution is the next step before any
   optimization bet.
2. **Set a gating FPS number** — the decree in `365s` step 4. Deferred to the Summoner: native-27 is the
   honest floor to gate against.
3. **`rendering_method` decision** — pick and commit a renderer (Forward+ vs Mobile vs Compatibility on
   an Intel UHD target) deliberately, not by default.

# 2026-07-16/17 OVERNIGHT — THE FIRST PER-SYSTEM ATTRIBUTION (365s Phase 0)

**Method.** `tests/overnight_bench.tscn` (new, unattended): boots `ai_stress_arena.tscn`, warms up 9s,
then drives the SAME F1–F6 toggles a human would press (injected `InputEventKey` — the real overlay
code path, not a reimplementation), 1.5s settle + 4.0s averaged sample per configuration. GPU-ms is
`RenderingServer.viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu` (the real driver figure). Renderer selected
via the `--rendering-method` CLI override — **`project.godot` was never edited**. Render scale pinned
at runtime and recorded on EVERY row.

**Hardware/scene:** Intel UHD · Godot 4.7.stable · `ai_stress_arena` = NIGHT firefight, dense jungle,
3D trees, flares/fires, 18v18 patrol→contact. **This is the adversarial scene (5kr3), not `game_world`.**

## THE HEADLINE — `all_systems_on` (no toggle applied; the trustworthy rows)

| renderer | render scale | fps | GPU ms | CPU ms | draw calls | primitives |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Forward+ | **1.00 native** | **18.8** | 51.94 | 44.35 | 911 | 806,793 |
| Forward+ | **0.75 / mode5 (shipped)** | 22.3 | 43.18 | 41.24 | 910 | 806,611 |
| Mobile | **1.00 native** | **25.5** | 36.89 | 37.98 | 527 | 807,370 |
| Mobile | **0.75 / mode5 (shipped)** | **29.9** | 31.24 | 34.28 | 526 | 806,125 |

**NOTHING CLEARS THE 30 FPS GATE IN THE NIGHT ARENA.** Best case — Mobile at the shipped 0.75/mode5 —
is **29.9 fps**. At native, the best any renderer manages is **25.5**.

**This corrects a live claim in this ledger.** The Phase-3 entry above says *"Mobile … 40.9 fps …
clears the gate at NATIVE"*. That was measured in `game_world` — **daytime, open ground, zero dynamic
lights: Mobile's best case.** In the adversarial night arena Mobile at native is **25.5**, not 40.9.
The +40% direction survives (**+36%**: 25.5 vs 18.8 at native); **the "clears the gate" conclusion does
not.** This is exactly the n=1 problem `5kr3` was filed to catch.

**Mobile roughly HALVES draw calls** (527 vs 911) at identical primitive counts.

## PER-SYSTEM ATTRIBUTION — Forward+ @ native 1.00 (deltas vs 51.94ms GPU / 18.8 fps)

| toggle OFF | fps | GPU ms | ΔGPU | primitives | Δprims |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **jungle patches (F1)** | 24.1 | 39.68 | **−12.26** | 234,355 | **−572,438** |
| **sun shadows (F6)** | 23.4 | 39.77 | **−12.17** | 687,601 | −119,192 |
| lights (F3) | 20.3 | 46.93 | −5.01 | 817,998 | +11,205 |
| characters (F4) | 19.9 | 48.61 | −3.33 | 697,559 | −109,234 |
| grass/clutter (F2) | 18.2 | 50.56 | −1.38 | 769,054 | −37,739 |

**1. The jungle is the bomb, and it is now MEASURED, not asserted.** −12.26ms GPU and
**−572,438 primitives — 71% of the frame's geometry** — from one toggle. 365s predicted "~350,000
alpha-tested triangles of overdraw" on reasoning alone; the real figure is larger.

**2. SUN SHADOWS COST AS MUCH AS THE ENTIRE JUNGLE (−12.17ms, 23% of the GPU frame), AND THE ARENA
BENCH IS HARDER THAN THE SHIPPED GAME.** `ai_stress_arena.gd:390` reads `sun.shadow_enabled = true`;
`game_world.gd:48` reads `light.shadow_enabled = false`. **The scene we judge FPS by carries a 12ms
shadow the shipped world does not.**

**⚠ Wave-2 correction — this is NOT a leftover and must NOT be "fixed".** ADR-026 (draft) line 29
states: *"0 shadow-casting dynamic lights. **The night sun's shadow is the one allowed dynamic
shadow**."* The arena is doing exactly what the draft sanctions. My first pass called this "the
cheapest measured win, needs no art, no LOD, no renderer decision" — **that framing was wrong**; it
implied a mistake where there is a decision. Untouched.

**What is a real question, and is the Summoner's:** `game_world` (no sun shadow) and the arena (sun
shadow) disagree, so **the 18.8/25.5 numbers are a worst case that the shipped night world may or may
not pay.** Whether the shipped game gets ADR-026's "one allowed dynamic shadow" decides whether ~12ms
belongs in the gate. That is an ADR-026 ratification question (`mok6`), not a bug.

**3. Grass/clutter is ~free (−1.38ms).** Any density pull there buys nothing and costs Pillar 2.

**4. The frame is NOT lopsidedly GPU-bound.** CPU 44.35ms vs GPU 51.94ms at native. Prior notes call
this "GPU fill-bound"; it is close to balanced, so a pure fill fix cannot get past ~19→23 fps alone.

## ⚠ CORRECTION (same night, Wave 2) — THE ATTRIBUTION ABOVE IS CONTAMINATED. READ THIS FIRST.

The first pass blamed the Mobile anomalies on "a re-batch storm / too-short settle" and called the
Forward+ deltas "the attribution of record". **Both claims were wrong. A control experiment killed them.**

**The control.** Six **identical** `all_systems_on` phases, **no toggle ever pressed**, Forward+ @ 1.00:

| phase | fps | GPU ms | CPU ms | draw calls | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| control_t0 | 17.9 | 54.04 | 45.94 | 1,013 | 829,798 |
| control_t1 | 18.5 | 50.74 | 58.04 | 968 | 813,867 |
| control_t2 | 19.0 | 49.93 | 66.09 | 1,007 | 817,770 |
| control_t3 | **15.7** | 49.60 | 68.76 | **1,243** | 843,247 |
| control_t4 | 19.0 | 50.38 | 36.58 | 1,219 | 845,029 |
| control_t5 | 16.8 | 50.19 | 66.49 | **1,268** | 848,371 |

**Nothing was changed between those six rows.** fps swings **15.7–19.0 (±10%)**, draw calls climb
**1,013 → 1,268 (+25%)**, CPU swings **36.6–68.8 (±47%)**.

**`ai_stress_arena` IS A LIVE 18v18 FIREFIGHT. IT ESCALATES WHILE YOU MEASURE IT.** Reinforcement
waves spawn, corpses and gibs accumulate, flares drift. A sequential toggle-diff therefore conflates
*the toggle* with *the clock*. That, not a settle time, is why `mobile lights_OFF` read **16.3 fps
(and 21.5 at a 5s settle) — worse than its own all-on baseline — while draw calls ROSE 627→864.**
Toggling a light off cannot add 237 draw calls. The arena did.

**What survives, measured against a ±3.3 fps / ±255-call / ±4.4ms-GPU noise floor:**

| finding | ΔGPU | verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| **jungle patches** | **−12.26ms, −572,438 prims** | **STANDS** — the primitive delta is ~4× the drift band and 71% of all geometry. Not noise. |
| **sun shadows** | **−12.17ms** | **STANDS** — ~3× the GPU noise band, and it was measured at the *most* contaminated (latest) phase, where drift makes frames *slower*. If anything it is **understated**. |
| lights | −5.01ms | **WITHDRAWN — inside the noise.** |
| characters | −3.33ms | **WITHDRAWN — inside the noise.** |
| grass/clutter | −1.38ms | **WITHDRAWN — inside the noise.** The "grass is free" claim is not established. |

**The renderer A/B STANDS.** All four `all_systems_on` rows are phase 1 (t≈9s post-warmup, no toggle),
so they are measured at the same point on the escalation curve. Control t0 (17.9) vs the A/B's Forward+
row (18.8) is ~1 fps of run-to-run spread; the Mobile gap is **+36%**, far outside it. **Nothing
clears 30** is likewise safe — the entire drift band sits below 30.

**Method debt this creates:** a live firefight is the right scene for a *renderer* A/B (identical
timepoint, two builds) and the **wrong** scene for a *toggle-diff*. Per-system attribution needs a
frozen arena (`hot_start=false`, no reinforcement waves, corpses disabled) or an A/B/A design that
re-measures the baseline between every toggle. Until then, only the two large findings above are real.

## STILL OWED

1. **The gating FPS number is the Summoner's to set** (365s step 4). Measured floor is now honest:
   **18.8 native / 22.3 shipped (Forward+), 25.5 native / 29.9 shipped (Mobile)** — night arena.
2. **`rendering_method` stays `forward_plus`** — unchanged tonight. Evidence is above; the call is his.
3. **Pillar-1 light-telegraph check under Mobile's ~8-omni cap NOT DONE** (5kr3's other half). An FPS
   number does not answer it, and a dropped muzzle flash is a Fairness-Law breach, not an atmosphere bug.

# 2026-07-18 OVERNIGHT — NO NEW FPS ROW, BY DESIGN

Task 45 asked for a native Forward+ datapoint in the populated patrol world. The overnight
stop-lines forbade windowed runs (Summoner asleep at the machine) and a headless dummy renderer
cannot measure GPU frames. **No number is recorded rather than a fake one.** The world DID get
heavier tonight (fsb_main = 678 meshes/1,116 bodies + 4 villages + 3 camps resident) and lighter
(billboard PNGs gone, procedural firebase gone, offer-flow scenes gone). First honest row = the
Summoner's morning walk-out with the F3 overlay, or the next sanctioned windowed bench.
